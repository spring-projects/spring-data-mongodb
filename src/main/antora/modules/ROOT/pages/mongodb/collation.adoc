= Collations

Since version 3.4, MongoDB supports collations for collection and index creation and various query operations.
Collations define string comparison rules based on the http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/concepts[ICU collations].
A collation document consists of various properties that are encapsulated in `Collation`, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,java]
----
Collation collation = Collation.of("fr")         <1>

  .strength(ComparisonLevel.secondary()          <2>
    .includeCase())

  .numericOrderingEnabled()                      <3>

  .alternate(Alternate.shifted().punct())        <4>

  .forwardDiacriticSort()                        <5>

  .normalizationEnabled();                       <6>
----
<1> `Collation` requires a locale for creation. This can be either a string representation of the locale, a `Locale` (considering language, country, and variant) or a `CollationLocale`. The locale is mandatory for creation.
<2> Collation strength defines comparison levels that denote differences between characters. You can configure various options (case-sensitivity, case-ordering, and others), depending on the selected strength.
<3> Specify whether to compare numeric strings as numbers or as strings.
<4> Specify whether the collation should consider whitespace and punctuation as base characters for purposes of comparison.
<5> Specify whether strings with diacritics sort from back of the string, such as with some French dictionary ordering.
<6> Specify whether to check whether text requires normalization and whether to perform normalization.
====

Collations can be used to create collections and indexes. If you create a collection that specifies a collation, the
collation is applied to index creation and queries unless you specify a different collation. A collation is valid for a
whole operation and cannot be specified on a per-field basis.

Like other metadata, collations can be be derived from the domain type via the `collation` attribute of the `@Document`
annotation and will be applied directly when running queries, creating collections or indexes.

NOTE: Annotated collations will not be used when a collection is auto created by MongoDB on first interaction. This would
require additional store interaction delaying the entire process. Please use `MongoOperations.createCollection` for those cases.

[source,java]
----
Collation french = Collation.of("fr");
Collation german = Collation.of("de");

template.createCollection(Person.class, CollectionOptions.just(collation));

template.indexOps(Person.class).ensureIndex(new Index("name", Direction.ASC).collation(german));
----

NOTE: MongoDB uses simple binary comparison if no collation is specified (`Collation.simple()`).

Using collations with collection operations is a matter of specifying a `Collation` instance in your query or operation options, as the following two examples show:

.Using collation with `find`
====
[source,java]
----
Collation collation = Collation.of("de");

Query query = new Query(Criteria.where("firstName").is("Am√©l")).collation(collation);

List<Person> results = template.find(query, Person.class);
----
====

.Using collation with `aggregate`
====
[source,java]
----
Collation collation = Collation.of("de");

AggregationOptions options = AggregationOptions.builder().collation(collation).build();

Aggregation aggregation = newAggregation(
  project("tags"),
  unwind("tags"),
  group("tags")
    .count().as("count")
).withOptions(options);

AggregationResults<TagCount> results = template.aggregate(aggregation, "tags", TagCount.class);
----
====

WARNING: Indexes are only used if the collation used for the operation matches the index collation.

xref:mongodb/repositories/repositories.adoc[MongoDB Repositories] support `Collations` via the `collation` attribute of the `@Query` annotation.
