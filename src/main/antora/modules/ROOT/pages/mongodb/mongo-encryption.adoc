= Encryption

Client Side Encryption is a feature that encrypts data in your application before it is sent to MongoDB.
We recommend you get familiar with the concepts, ideally from the https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/security-in-use-encryption/[MongoDB Documentation] to learn more about its capabilities and restrictions before you continue applying Encryption through Spring Data.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure to set the drivers `com.mongodb.AutoEncryptionSettings` to use client-side encryption.
MongoDB does not support encryption for all field types.
Specific data types require deterministic encryption to preserve equality comparison functionality.
====

== Client Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE)

Choosing CSFLE gives you full flexibility and allows you to use different keys for a single field, eg. in a one key per tenant scenario. +
Please make sure to consult the https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/[MongoDB CSFLE Documentation] before you continue reading.

[[mongo.encryption.automatic]]
=== Automatic Encryption (CSFLE)

MongoDB supports https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/[Client-Side Field Level Encryption] out of the box using the MongoDB driver with its Automatic Encryption feature.
Automatic Encryption requires a xref:mongodb/mapping/mapping-schema.adoc[JSON Schema] that allows to perform encrypted read and write operations without the need to provide an explicit en-/decryption step.

Please refer to the xref:mongodb/mapping/mapping-schema.adoc#mongo.jsonSchema.encrypted-fields[JSON Schema] section for more information on defining a JSON Schema that holds encryption information.

To make use of a the `MongoJsonSchema` it needs to be combined with `AutoEncryptionSettings` which can be done eg. via a `MongoClientSettingsBuilderCustomizer`.

[source,java]
----
@Bean
MongoClientSettingsBuilderCustomizer customizer(MappingContext mappingContext) {
    return (builder) -> {

        // ... keyVaultCollection, kmsProvider, ...

        MongoJsonSchemaCreator schemaCreator = MongoJsonSchemaCreator.create(mappingContext);
        MongoJsonSchema patientSchema = schemaCreator
            .filter(MongoJsonSchemaCreator.encryptedOnly())
            .createSchemaFor(Patient.class);

        AutoEncryptionSettings autoEncryptionSettings = AutoEncryptionSettings.builder()
            .keyVaultNamespace(keyVaultCollection)
            .kmsProviders(kmsProviders)
            .extraOptions(extraOpts)
            .schemaMap(Collections.singletonMap("db.patient", patientSchema.schemaDocument().toBsonDocument()))
            .build();

        builder.autoEncryptionSettings(autoEncryptionSettings);
    };
}
----

[[mongo.encryption.explicit]]
=== Explicit Encryption (CSFLE)

Explicit encryption uses the MongoDB driver's encryption library (`org.mongodb:mongodb-crypt`) to perform encryption and decryption tasks.
The `@ExplicitEncrypted` annotation is a combination of the `@Encrypted` annotation used for xref:mongodb/mapping/mapping-schema.adoc#mongo.jsonSchema.encrypted-fields[JSON Schema creation] and a xref:mongodb/mapping/property-converters.adoc[Property Converter].
In other words, `@ExplicitEncrypted` uses existing building blocks to combine them for simplified explicit encryption support.

[NOTE]
====
Fields annotated with `@ExplicitEncrypted` are always encrypted as whole.
Consider the following example:

[source,java]
----
@ExplicitEncrypted(…)
String simpleValue;        <1>

@ExplicitEncrypted(…)
Address address;           <2>

@ExplicitEncrypted(…)
List<...> list;            <3>

@ExplicitEncrypted(…)
Map<..., ...> mapOfString; <4>
----

<1> Encrypts the value of the simple type such as a `String` if not `null`.
<2> Encrypts the entire `Address` object and all its nested fields as `Document`.
To only encrypt parts of the `Address`, like `Address#street` the `street` field within `Address` needs to be annotated with `@ExplicitEncrypted`.
<3> ``Collection``-like fields are encrypted as single value and not per entry.
<4> ``Map``-like fields are encrypted as single value and not as a key/value entry.
====

Client-Side Field Level Encryption allows you to choose between a deterministic and a randomized algorithm. Depending on the https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/reference/security-client-side-automatic-json-schema/#std-label-field-level-encryption-json-schema/[chosen algorithm], https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/reference/supported-operations/[different operations] may be supported.
To pick a certain algorithm use `@ExplicitEncrypted(algorithm)`, see `EncryptionAlgorithms` for algorithm constants.
Please read the https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/fundamentals/encryption-algorithms[Encryption Types] manual for more information on algorithms and their usage.

To perform the actual encryption we require a Data Encryption Key (DEK).
Please refer to the https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/csfle/quick-start/#create-a-data-encryption-key[MongoDB Documentation] for more information on how to set up key management and create a Data Encryption Key.
The DEK can be referenced directly via its `id` or a defined _alternative name_.
The `@EncryptedField` annotation only allows referencing a DEK via an alternative name.
It is possible to provide an `EncryptionKeyResolver`, which will be discussed later, to any DEK.

.Reference the Data Encryption Key
====
[source,java]
----
@EncryptedField(algorithm=…, altKeyName = "secret-key") <1>
String ssn;
----

[source,java]
----
@EncryptedField(algorithm=…, altKeyName = "/name")      <2>
String ssn;
----

<1> Use the DEK stored with the alternative name `secret-key`.
<2> Uses a field reference that will read the actual field value and use that for key lookup.
Always requires the full document to be present for save operations.
Fields cannot be used in queries/aggregations.
====

By default, the `@ExplicitEncrypted(value=…)` attribute references a `MongoEncryptionConverter`.
It is possible to change the default implementation and exchange it with any `PropertyValueConverter` implementation by providing the according type reference.
To learn more about custom `PropertyValueConverters` and the required configuration, please refer to the xref:mongodb/mapping/property-converters.adoc[Property Converters - Mapping specific fields] section.

[[mongo.encryption.queryable]]
== Queryable Encryption (QE)

Choosing QE enables you to run different types of queries, like _range_ or _equality_, against encrypted fields. +
Please make sure to consult the https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/queryable-encryption/[MongoDB QE Documentation] before you continue reading to learn more about QE features and limitations.

=== Collection Setup

Queryable Encryption requires upfront declaration of certain aspects allowed within an actual query against an encrypted field.
The information covers the algorithm in use as well as allowed query types along with their attributes and must be provided when creating the collection.

`MongoOperations#createCollection(...)` can be used to do the initial setup for collections utilizing QE.
The configuration for QE via Spring Data uses the same building blocks (a xref:mongodb/mapping/mapping-schema.adoc#mongo.jsonSchema.encrypted-fields[JSON Schema creation]) as CSFLE, converting the schema/properties into the configuration format required by MongoDB.

You can configure Queryable Encryption either manually or in a derived way:

**Manual setup**

Manual setup gives you full control over how encrypted fields are declared and how collections are created.
It's useful when you need to explicitly manage data keys, encryption algorithms, and field mappings.

** ✅ Full control over encryption configuration
** ✅ Explicitly manage data keys and algorithms
** ✅ Allows for complex encryption scenarios
** ✅ Explicit configuration avoids the risk of surprises (e.g. missing configuration because of improper annotations or class-path scanning)
** ⚠️ An Explicit Field Configuration can diverge from the domain model and you must keep it in sync with the domain model

**Derived setup**

Derived setup relies on annotations in your domain model and automatically generates the required encrypted field configuration from it.
This is simpler and recommended for typical Spring applications where your data model is already annotated.

** ✅ Domain model-driven configuration
** ✅ Easy to set up and maintain
** ⚠️ Might not cover all complex scenarios
** ⚠️ Risk of surprises (e.g. missing configuration for documents based on subtypes because of improper annotations or class-path scanning)

====
[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes",role="primary"]
----

BsonBinary pinDK = clientEncryption.createDataKey("local", new com.mongodb.client.model.vault.DataKeyOptions());
BsonBinary ssnDK = clientEncryption.createDataKey("local", new com.mongodb.client.model.vault.DataKeyOptions());
BsonBinary ageDK = clientEncryption.createDataKey("local", new com.mongodb.client.model.vault.DataKeyOptions());
BsonBinary signDK = clientEncryption.createDataKey("local", new com.mongodb.client.model.vault.DataKeyOptions());

CollectionOptions collectionOptions = CollectionOptions.encryptedCollection(options -> options
    .encrypted(string("pin"), pinDK)
    .queryable(encrypted(string("ssn")).algorithm("Indexed").keyId(ssnDK.asUuid()), equality().contention(0))
    .queryable(encrypted(int32("age")).algorithm("Range").keyId(ageDK.asUuid()), range().contention(8).min(0).max(150))
    .queryable(encrypted(int64("address.sign")).algorithm("Range").keyId(signDK.asUuid()), range().contention(2).min(-10L).max(10L))
);

mongoTemplate.createCollection(Patient.class, collectionOptions); <1>
----
<1> Using the template to create the collection may prevent capturing generated keyIds. In this case render the `Document` from the options and use the `createEncryptedCollection(...)` method via the encryption library.

class Patient {

    @Id String id;        <1>

    @Encrypted(algorithm = "Unindexed")
    String pin;           <2>

    @Encrypted(algorithm = "Indexed")

    @RangeEncrypted(contentionFactor = 8, rangeOptions = "{ 'min' : 0, 'max' : 150 }")
    Integer age;          <4>

    @RangeEncrypted(contentionFactor = 0L,
        rangeOptions = "{\"min\": {\"$numberDouble\": \"0.3\"}, \"max\": {\"$numberDouble\": \"2.5\"}, \"precision\": 2 }")
    double height;        <5>
}

MongoJsonSchema patientSchema = MongoJsonSchemaCreator.create(mappingContext)
    .filter(MongoJsonSchemaCreator.encryptedOnly())
    .createSchemaFor(Patient.class);

Document encryptedFields = CollectionOptions.encryptedCollection(patientSchema)
        .getEncryptedFieldsOptions()
        .map(CollectionOptions.EncryptedFieldsOptions::toDocument)
        .orElseThrow();

template.execute(db -> clientEncryption.createEncryptedCollection(db, template.getCollectionName(Patient.class), new CreateCollectionOptions()
        .encryptedFields(encryptedFields), new CreateEncryptedCollectionParams("local"))); <1>

----

<1> `id` and `address` are not encrypted.
Those fields can be queried normally.
<2> `pin` is encrypted but does not support queries.
<3> `ssn` is encrypted and allows equality queries.
<4> `age` is encrypted and allows range queries between `0` and `150`.
<5> `height` is encrypted and allows range queries between `0.3` and `2.5`.

The `Queryable` annotation allows to define allowed query types for encrypted fields.
`@RangeEncrypted` is a combination of `@Encrypted` and `@Queryable` for fields allowing `range` queries.
It is possible to create custom annotations out of the provided ones.

[NOTE]
====
- It is not possible to use both QE and CSFLE within the same collection.
- It is not possible to query a `range` indexed field with an `equality` operator.
- It is not possible to query an `equality` indexed field with a `range` operator.
- It is not possible to set `bypassAutoEncrytion(true)`.
- It is not possible to use self maintained encryption keys via `@Encrypted` in combination with Queryable Encryption.
- Contention is only optional on the server side, the clients requires you to set the value (Default us `8`).
- Additional options for eg. `min` and `max` need to match the actual field type. Make sure to use `$numberLong` etc. to ensure target types when parsing bson String.
- Queryable Encryption will an extra field `__safeContent__` to each of your documents.
Unless explicitly excluded the field will be loaded into memory when retrieving results.

[[mongo.encryption.queryable.automatic]]
=== Automatic Encryption (QE)

MongoDB supports Queryable Encryption out of the box using the MongoDB driver with its Automatic Encryption feature.
Automatic Encryption requires a xref:mongodb/mapping/mapping-schema.adoc[JSON Schema] that allows to perform encrypted read and write operations without the need to provide an explicit en-/decryption step.

All you need to do is create the collection according to the MongoDB documentation.
You may utilize techniques to create the required configuration outlined in the section above.

[[mongo.encryption.queryable.manual]]
=== Explicit Encryption (QE)

Explicit encryption uses the MongoDB driver's encryption library (`org.mongodb:mongodb-crypt`) to perform encryption and decryption tasks based on the meta information provided by annotation within the domain model.

[NOTE]
====
There is no official support for using Explicit Queryable Encryption.
The audacious user may combine `@Encrypted` and `@Queryable` with `@ValueConverter(MongoEncryptionConverter.class)` at their own risk.
====

[[mongo.encryption.explicit-setup]]
[[mongo.encryption.converter-setup]]
== MongoEncryptionConverter Setup

The converter setup for `MongoEncryptionConverter` requires a few steps as several components are involved.
The bean setup consists of the following:

1. The `ClientEncryption` engine
2. A `MongoEncryptionConverter` instance configured with `ClientEncryption` and a `EncryptionKeyResolver`.
3. A `PropertyValueConverterFactory` that uses the registered `MongoEncryptionConverter` bean.

The `EncryptionKeyResolver` uses an `EncryptionContext` providing access to the property allowing for dynamic DEK resolution.

.Sample MongoEncryptionConverter Configuration
====
[source,java]
----
class Config extends AbstractMongoClientConfiguration {

    @Autowired ApplicationContext appContext;

    @Bean
    ClientEncryption clientEncryption() {                                                            <1>
        ClientEncryptionSettings encryptionSettings = ClientEncryptionSettings.builder();
        // …

        return ClientEncryptions.create(encryptionSettings);
    }

    @Bean
    MongoEncryptionConverter encryptingConverter(ClientEncryption clientEncryption) {

        Encryption<BsonValue, BsonBinary> encryption = MongoClientEncryption.just(clientEncryption);
        EncryptionKeyResolver keyResolver = EncryptionKeyResolver.annotated((ctx) -> …);             <2>

        return new MongoEncryptionConverter(encryption, keyResolver);                                <3>
    }

    @Override
    protected void configureConverters(MongoConverterConfigurationAdapter adapter) {

        adapter
            .registerPropertyValueConverterFactory(PropertyValueConverterFactory.beanFactoryAware(appContext)); <4>
    }
}
----

<1> Set up a `Encryption` engine using `com.mongodb.client.vault.ClientEncryption`.
The instance is stateful and must be closed after usage.
Spring takes care of this because `ClientEncryption` is ``Closeable``.
<2> Set up an annotation-based `EncryptionKeyResolver` to determine the `EncryptionKey` from annotations.
<3> Create the `MongoEncryptionConverter`.
<4> Enable for a `PropertyValueConverter` lookup from the `BeanFactory`.
