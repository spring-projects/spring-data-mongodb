= Requirements

The Spring Data MongoDB 4.x binaries require JDK level 17 and above and https://spring.io/docs[Spring Framework] {springVersion} and above.

In terms of database and driver, you need at least version 4.x of https://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB] and a compatible MongoDB Java Driver (4.x or 5.x).

[[compatibility.matrix]]
== Compatibility Matrix

The following compatibility matrix summarizes Spring Data versions to MongoDB driver/database versions.
Database versions show the highest supported server version that pass the Spring Data test suite.
You can use newer server versions unless your application uses functionality that is affected by xref:preface.adoc#compatibility.changes[changes in the MongoDB server].
See also the https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/current/compatibility/[official MongoDB driver compatibility matrix] for driver- and server version compatibility.
