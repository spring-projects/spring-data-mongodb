= Requirements

The Spring Data MongoDB 4.x binaries require JDK level 17 and above and https://spring.io/docs[Spring Framework] {springVersion} and above.

In terms of database and driver, you need at least version 4.x of https://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB] and a compatible MongoDB Java Driver (4.x or 5.x).

[[compatibility.matrix]]
== Compatibility Matrix

The following compatibility matrix summarizes Spring Data versions to MongoDB driver/database versions.
Database versions show server generations that pass the Spring Data test suite.
You can use newer server versions unless your application uses functionality that is affected by xref:preface.adoc#compatibility.changes[changes in the MongoDB server].
See also the https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/current/compatibility/[official MongoDB driver compatibility matrix] for driver- and server version compatibility.
