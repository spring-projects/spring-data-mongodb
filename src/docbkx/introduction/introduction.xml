  <para><para>This document is the reference guide for Spring Data - Document
  Support. It explains Document module concepts and semantics and the syntax
  for various stores namespaces. </para><para>This section provides some basic
  introduction to Spring and Document database. The rest of the document
  refers only to Spring Data Document features and assumes the user is
  familiar with document databases such as MongoDB and CouchDB as well as
  Spring concepts. </para><section id="get-started:first-steps:spring">
      <title>Knowing Spring</title>

      <para>Spring Data uses heavily Spring framework's <ulink
      url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/spring-core.html">core
      </ulink> functionality, such as the <ulink
      url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/beans.html">IoC
      </ulink> container, <ulink
      url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/resources.html">resource
      </ulink> abstract or <ulink
      url="http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/reference/aop.html">AOP
      </ulink> infrastructure. While it is not important to know the Spring
      APIs, understanding the concepts behind them is. At a minimum, the idea
      behind IoC should be familiar. These being said, the more knowledge one
      has about the Spring, the faster she will pick up Spring Data Document.
      Besides the very comprehensive (and sometimes disarming) documentation
      that explains in detail the Spring Framework, there are a lot of
      articles, blog entries and books on the matter - take a look at the
      Spring framework <ulink

      more information.</para>

      <title>Knowing NoSQL and Document databases</title>

      <para>NoSQL stores have taken the storage world by storm. It is a vast
      domain with a plethora of solutions, terms and patterns (to make things
      worth even the term itself has multiple <ulink
      url="http://www.google.com/search?q=nosoql+acronym">meanings</ulink>).
      While some of the principles are common, it is crucial that the user is
      familiar to some degree with the stores supported by DATADOC. The best
      way to get acquainted to this solutions is to read their documentation
      and follow their examples - it usually doesn't take more then 5-10
      minutes to go through them and if you are coming from an RDMBS-only
      background many times these exercises can be an eye opener.</para>
