The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.

The Spring Data MongoDB project aims to provide a familiar and consistent Spring-based programming model for new datastores while retaining store-specific features and capabilities.
The Spring Data MongoDB project provides integration with the MongoDB document database.
Key functional areas of Spring Data MongoDB are a POJO centric model for interacting with a MongoDB `+Document+` and easily writing a repository style data access layer.

== Getting Started

Here is a quick teaser of an application using Spring Data Repositories in Java:

[source,java]
----
public interface PersonRepository extends CrudRepository<Person, Long> {

  List<Person> findByLastname(String lastname);

  List<Person> findByFirstnameLike(String firstname);
}

@Service
public class MyService {

  private final PersonRepository repository;

  public MyService(PersonRepository repository) {
    this.repository = repository;
  }

  public void doWork() {

    repository.deleteAll();

    Person person = new Person();
    person.setFirstname("Oliver");
    person.setLastname("Gierke");
    repository.save(person);

    List<Person> lastNameResults = repository.findByLastname("Gierke");
    List<Person> firstNameResults = repository.findByFirstnameLike("Oli*");
 }
}

@Configuration
@EnableMongoRepositories
class ApplicationConfig extends AbstractMongoClientConfiguration {

  @Override
  protected String getDatabaseName() {
    return "springdata";
  }
}

[[building-from-source]]
== Building from Source

You do not need to build from source to use Spring Data. Binaries are available in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io].
and accessible from Maven using the Maven configuration noted <<maven-configuration,above>>.

NOTE: Configuration for Gradle is similar to Maven.

The best way to get started is by creating a Spring Boot project using MongoDB on https://start.spring.io[start.spring.io].
Follow this https://start.spring.io/#type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.5.4&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=com.example&artifactId=demo&name=demo&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.demo&dependencies=data-mongodb[link]
to build an imperative application and this https://start.spring.io/#type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.5.4&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=com.example&artifactId=demo&name=demo&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.demo&dependencies=data-mongodb-reactive[link]
to build a reactive one.

However, if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper]
and minimally JDK 8 (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/[JDK downloads]).

In order to build Spring Data MongoDB, first you will need to https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community[download]
and install a MongoDB distribution. Select "_On-premises (MongoDB locally)_", then "_MongoDB Community Server_"
and in the page form, select the platform matching your system along with the version of MongoDB on which Spring Data
MongoDB is based (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-mongodb/blob/3.2.5/pom.xml#L30[for example]).

Once you have installed MongoDB, you need to start a MongoDB server. It is convenient to set an environment variable to
your MongoDB installation (e.g. `MONGODB_HOME`).

To run the MongoDB server enter the following command from a command-line:

[source,bash]
----
$ $MONGODB_HOME/bin/mongod --dbpath $MONGODB_HOME/runtime/data --ipv6 --port 27017 --replSet rs0
...
{"t":{"$date":"2021-09-22T11:22:05.490-07:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"NETWORK",  "id":20113,   "ctx":"LogicalSessionCacheReap",
"msg":"Successfully connected to host","attr":{"connString":"127.0.0.1:27017","numOpenConns":1,"socketTimeoutSecs":0.0}}
----

Once the MongoDB server starts up, you should see the message (`msg`), "_Successfully connected to host_".

Notice the `--dbpath` option to the `mongod` command. You can set this to anything you like, but in this case, we set
the absolute path to a sub-directory (`runtime/data/`) under the MongoDB installation directory (in `$MONGODB_HOME`).
You might have other sub-directories as well, such as `runtime/logs/` for instance, if you wish to write your logs to
a file rather than standard out, using the `--logpath` option to the `mongod` command. In this way, all your "runtime"
files for the MongoDB server are conveniently located in one place.

Next, you need to initialize the MongoDB replica set the first time the MongoDB server is started. Replicas are used by
the Spring Data MongoDB transactional tests. This only needs to be done once after the initial start. If you restart
your MongoDB server, you will need to initialize the replica set again. However, you can continue to use the same
MongoDB server for multiple builds of Spring Data MongoDB.

To initialize the replica set, you must start a mongo client:

[source,bash]
----
$ $MONGODB_HOME/bin/mongo
MongoDB server version: 4.4.8
---
The server generated these startup warnings when booting:
        2021-09-22T11:26:50.752-07:00: Access control is not enabled for the database. Read and write access to data and configuration is unrestricted
        2021-09-22T11:26:50.752-07:00: This server is bound to localhost. Remote systems will be unable to connect to this server. Start the server with --bind_ip <address> to specify which IP addresses it should serve responses from, or with --bind_ip_all to bind to all interfaces. If this behavior is desired, start the server with --bind_ip 127.0.0.1 to disable this warning
        2021-09-22T11:26:50.752-07:00: Soft rlimits too low
        2021-09-22T11:26:50.752-07:00:         currentValue: 256
        2021-09-22T11:26:50.752-07:00:         recommendedMinimum: 64000
---
---
        Enable MongoDB's free cloud-based monitoring service, which will then receive and display
        metrics about your deployment (disk utilization, CPU, operation statistics, etc).

        The monitoring data will be available on a MongoDB website with a unique URL accessible to you
        and anyone you share the URL with. MongoDB may use this information to make product
        improvements and to suggest MongoDB products and deployment options to you.

        To enable free monitoring, run the following command: db.enableFreeMonitoring()
        To permanently disable this reminder, run the following command: db.disableFreeMonitoring()
---
rs0:PRIMARY>
----

Then enter the following command:

[source,bash]
----
rs0:PRIMARY> rs.initiate({ _id: 'rs0', members: [ { _id: 0, host: '127.0.0.1:27017' } ] })
{
	"operationTime" : Timestamp(1632335237, 1),
	"ok" : 0,
	"errmsg" : "already initialized",
	"code" : 23,
	"codeName" : "AlreadyInitialized",
	"$clusterTime" : {
		"clusterTime" : Timestamp(1632335237, 1),
		"signature" : {
			"hash" : BinData(0,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA="),
			"keyId" : NumberLong(0)
		}
	}
}
rs0:PRIMARY>
----

Finally, you may need to adjust the `ulimit` on your UNIX-based system (for example, Linux or Mac OS X). Currently,
the MongoDB client/server combination uses many Socket connections (which equate to file descriptors on a UNIX-based
system) throughout the Spring Data MongoDB test suite lifecycle. You can inspect your current `ulimit` with
the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ ulimit -a
core file size          (blocks, -c) 0
data seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited
file size               (blocks, -f) unlimited
max locked memory       (kbytes, -l) unlimited
max memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited
open files                      (-n) 256
pipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 1
stack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192
cpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited
max user processes              (-u) 5568
virtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited
----

In this case, we are interested in the `ulimit` setting for "_open files_". As you can see above, this is set to 256.
You will need to adjust this with the following command (we recommend 32768):

[source,bash]
----
$ ulimit -n 32768
----

You can use `ulimit -a` again to verify the `ulimit` on "_open files_" was set appropriately.

Now you are ready to build Spring Data MongoDB. Simply enter the following `mvnw` (Maven Wrapper) command:

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.5.0 or above].

_Also see link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] if you wish to submit pull requests, and in particular, please sign
the https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor’s Agreement] before your first non-trivial change._

=== Building reference documentation

Building the documentation builds also the project without running tests.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install -Pdistribute
----

The generated documentation is available from `target/site/reference/html/index.html`.
