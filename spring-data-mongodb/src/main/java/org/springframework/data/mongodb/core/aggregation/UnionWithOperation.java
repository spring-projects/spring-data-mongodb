/**
 * The <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/master/reference/operator/aggregation/unionWith/">$unionWith</a> aggregation
 * stage (available since MongoDB 4.4) performs a union of two collections by combining pipeline results, potentially
 * containing duplicates, into a single result set that is handed over to the next stage. <br />
 * In order to remove duplicates it is possible to append a {@link GroupOperation} right after
 * {@link UnionWithOperation}.
 * <br />
 * If the {@link UnionWithOperation} uses a
 * <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/master/reference/operator/aggregation/unionWith/#unionwith-pipeline">pipeline</a>
 * to process documents, field names within the pipeline will be treated as is. In order to map domain type property
 * names to actual field names (considering potential {@link org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.mapping.Field}
 * annotations) make sure the enclosing aggregation is a {@link TypedAggregation} and provide the target type for the
 * {@code $unionWith} stage via {@link #mapFieldsTo(Class)}.
